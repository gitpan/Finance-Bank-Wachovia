Finance::Bank::Wachovia version 0.01
==================================

Finance::Bank::Wachovia - access account info from Perl

       * Account numbers
       * Account names
       * Account balances (posted and available)
       * Account transaction data (in all their detailed glory)

       Does not (yet) provide any means to transfer money or pay bills.

SYNOPSIS
       Since this version uses the website to get account info, it will need
       the information to login: Customer access number, Pin, and Code word.
       The "other way" to log in is not currently supported*.

         use Finance::Bank::Wachovia;

         my $wachovia  = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new(
               customer_access_number => '123456789',
               pin     => '1234',
               code_word       => 'blah'
         );

         my @account_numbers           = $wachovia->account_numbers();
         my @account_names             = $wachovia->account_names();
         my @account_balances  = $wachovia->account_balanes();

         my $account = $wachovia->account( $account_numbers[0] );
         print "Number: ", $account->number, "\n";
         print "Name: ", $account->name, "\n";
         print "Type: ", $account->type, "\n";
         print "Avail. Bal.: ", $account->available_balance, "\n";
         print "Posted.Bal.: ", $account->posted_balance, "\n";

         my $transactions = $account->transactions;

         foreach my $t ( @$transactions ){
               print "Date: ",     $t->date,              "\n",
                     "Action: ",   $t->action,            "\n",
                     "Desc: ",     $t->description,       "\n",
                     "Withdrawal", $t->withdrawal_amount, "\n",
                     "Deposit",    $t->deposit_amount,    "\n",
                     "Balance",    $t->balance,           "\n",
                     "seq_no",     $t->seq_no,            "\n",
                     "trans_code", $t->trans_code,        "\n",
                     "check_num",  $t->check_num,         "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Internally uses WWW::Mechanize to scrape the bank's website.  The idea
       was to keep the interface as logical as possible.  The user is com-
       pletely abstracted from how the data is obtained, and to a large degree
       so is the module itself.  In case wachovia ever offers an XML inter-
       face, or even soap, this should be an easy module to add to, but the
       interface will not change, so your code won't have too either.
