=head1 NAME

Finance::Bank::Wachovia - access account info from Perl

=over 1

=item * Account numbers

=item * Account names

=item * Account balances (posted and available)

=item * Account transaction data (in all their detailed glory)

=back

Does not (yet) provide any means to transfer money or pay bills.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Since this version uses the website to get account info, it will need the information to login:
There are two ways to login via the wachovia website, and depending on which login method you use, that decides which parameters you'll provide to the new() method.
If you use the Customer access number method (left form on the website) then provide "customer_access_number", "pin", and "code_word".  If you use the user id method (right form on the website)
then provide "user_id" and "password".

  use Finance::Bank::Wachovia;
  
  # Two different types of login information,
  # if you login using can/pin/codeword:
  my $wachovia  = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new(
      customer_access_number => '123456789',
      pin                    => '1234',
      code_word              => 'blah'
  ) or die Finance::Bank::Wachovia->ErrStr();
  
  # OR if you login using user_id/password:
  $wachovia = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new(
      user_id  => 'foo',
      password => 'bar'  
  ) or die Finance::Bank::Wachovia->ErrStr();
  
  my @account_numbers		= $wachovia->account_numbers();
  my @account_names		= $wachovia->account_names();
  my @account_balances	= $wachovia->account_balances();

  my $account = $wachovia->account( $account_numbers[0] )
  	or die $wachovia->ErrStr();;
  print "Number: ", $account->number, "\n";
  print "Name: ", $account->name, "\n";
  print "Type: ", $account->type, "\n";
  print "Avail. Bal.: ", $account->available_balance, "\n";
  print "Posted.Bal.: ", $account->posted_balance, "\n";
  
  my $transactions = $account->transactions
  	or die $account->ErrStr;
  
  foreach my $t ( @$transactions ){
  	print "Date: ",     $t->date,              "\n",
  	      "Action: ",   $t->action,            "\n",
  	      "Desc: ",     $t->description,       "\n",
  	      "Withdrawal", $t->withdrawal_amount, "\n",
  	      "Deposit",    $t->deposit_amount,    "\n",
  	      "Balance",    $t->balance,           "\n",
  	      "seq_no",     $t->seq_no,            "\n",
  	      "trans_code", $t->trans_code,        "\n",
  	      "check_num",  $t->check_num,         "\n";
  } 
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Internally uses WWW::Mechanize to scrape the bank's website.  The idea was to keep
the interface as logical as possible.  The user is completely abstracted from how the
data is obtained, and to a large degree so is the module itself.  In case wachovia ever offers
an XML interface, or soap, or DBI (right) this should be an easy module to add to/modify, 
but the application interface will not change, so YOUR code won't have to either.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Returns object Finance::Bank::Wachovia object.  This is when you should define your login
information.  There are currently two login methods, the 3 argument "can/pin/codeword" method,
and the two argument "user_id/password" method.  Which one you need to use depends on how you 
login to your account via the wachovia website.

If you use the can/pin/codeword method, then:

  my $wachovia = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new(
      customer_access_number => '123456789',
      pin                    => '1234',
      code_word              => 'blah'
  );
  
And if you use the user_id/password method, then:

  my $wachovia = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new(
      user_id  => 'foo',
      password => 'bar'
  );
  
On wachovia's website they say that eventually everyone will be migrated to the userid/password method.
  
=head2 account_numbers

Returns a list of account numbers (from the Relationship Summary Page).

  my @numbers = $wachovia->account_numbers();
  
=head2 account_names

Returns (in lowercase) a list of account names (ie: "exp access") (from the Relationship Summary Page).

  my @names = $wachovia->account_names;
  
=head2 account_balances

Returns a list of account balances (from Relationship Summary page ).

  my @balances = $wachovia->account_balances;
  
=head2 account

Returns a Finance::Bank::Wachovia::Account object.  This object can be used to 
get any info available about an account, including posted/available balances, 
it's name, type, number, and a list of all it's transactions.  See the perldocs for
Finance::Bank::Wachovia::Account for info on what to do with the object. (or just look at the
code example in the "How to use" section of this perldoc.

  my $account = $wachovia->account( $account_num );

=head1 WORTH MENTIONING

Doug Feuerbach had the idea for storing login information in an encrypted file to be accessed via a password (like apple's keychain).  
Then he gave me the code to implement it.  He thinks it's silly to thank him for something "so trivial", but he should know that
it's not an official perl module without a "thanks" going out to someone by name.  The program included with the module makes use of 
his contribution.  Thanks Doug.

Also, thanks to the Giants that authored all the modules that made the conception and creation of this module so easy.  Your shoulder's are awesome.

Where would we all be without Perl?  Checking our account balances over the phone, that's where.  Thanks to Larry Wall.

Thanks to Jason Marcell for helping me test/debug the user_id/password login in a pretty short amount of time.
