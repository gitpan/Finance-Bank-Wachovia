        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new() now accepts 
          can/pin/codeword OR user_id/password.
        * Added exception handling via Error() and ErrStr()
        * wachovia.pl now save .wachovia file in home directory by default,
          instead of just the current directory.
          
        [FIXES]
        * Adjusted Makefile.PL to require 5.6.1, not 5.8
        * Changed bin to scripts, added EXE_FILES line to Makefile.PL

        * fixed some typos
