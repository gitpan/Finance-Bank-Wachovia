    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    * made wachovia.pl and wachovia_summary.pl accept variations of their
      arguments so you can use --user --userid --user-id --user_id --login, and
      it's all the same.
    * wachovia.pl script: usefulness of --details argument has been augmented.
      Now you can specify how many transactions you want displayed, including:
      --details=all
    
    [FIXES]
    * made the warning about form name go away.  This started popping up when 
      wachovia 
      changed their website.
    * removed VERSIONS from all the other module files, the only one that really 
      matters is Wachovia.pm, and remembering to change the others was a PITA.
      
    [DOCUMENTATION]
    * changed wachovia.pl docs to reflect change in --details argument
    
    [THANKS]
    Clint and Jason for hitting me with the emails.

    [FIXES]
    * change WWW.pm to handle slight modification to Wachovia's login routine.
      Note, this is untested with the CAN type of login.  If you have problems,
      let me know.
    
    [THANKS]
    Jason Marcell, again, for being my early alert system.
    
    [AND A BIG THANKS]
    To Wachovia, who never returned my calls when I was trying to work WITH them
    to improve the legitimacy of this module.  I really wanted to see if they
    had a secure web services interface so the module wouldn't be dependent on 
    the fragile screen scraping.  Oh well.  Just another bank satisfied with
    mediocrity.
