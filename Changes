		[ENHANCEMENTS]
		* made wachovia.pl and wachovia_summary.pl accept variations of their arguments
		  so you can use --user --userid --user-id --user_id --login, and it's all the same.
		* wachovia.pl script: usefulness of --details argument has been augmented.  Now you can
		  specify how many transactions you want displayed, including: --details=all
		
		[FIXES]
		* made the warning about form name go away.  This started popping up when wachovia 
		  changed their website.
		* removed VERSIONS from all the other module files, the only one that really matters
		  is Wachovia.pm, and remembering to change the others was a PITA.
		  
		[DOCUMENTATION]
		* changed wachovia.pl docs to reflect change in --details argument
		
		[THANKS]
		Clint and Jason for hitting me with the emails.
